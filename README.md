# Simon Game

A browser-based Simon game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Description

This is a classic Simon game where the user has to repeat a sequence of colors and sounds. Each round, the sequence gets longer and more challenging. The game uses DOM manipulation (using jQuery) and audio playback to provide an interactive experience.

## How to Play

- Listen and watch the sequence of lights and sounds.
- Repeat the sequence by clicking the buttons in the correct order.
- Progress through increasingly difficult levels.
- If you make a mistake, the game ends.
